Lot's has happen in the past month with jQuery.

**[14 days of jQuery](http://jquery14.com/)** - We had 14 days of great links videos and info leading up and after the release of jQuery 1.4.

**[jQuery API](api.jquery.com/)** - the jQuery API doc's got a much needed overhall and are now running on Wordpress.  Some very slick searching and the ability to comment on the documentation has brought live back in to the docs.

[**jQuery 1.4**](http://jquery.com/) was released in to the wild with tons of bug fixes, lots of speed enhancements and a few nice new features sprinkled on top to make it the prefect candy for all jQuery users to quickly flock to.

**[jQuery Forums](forum.jquery.com/)** packed up and moved from Google to Zoho which has produced a spam free forum again for the jQuery community

[**jQuery UI 1.8 rc1**](http://jqueryui.com/) has been released with a final release soon to come, bringing us 2 new widgets, button and autocomplete, along with a lot of bug fixes and improvements including an overhauled widget factory.

[**jQAIP**](http://jqapi.com/) an alternative viewer of the jQuery Doc's was released for those who don't like the design or workings of api.jquery.com.  Has its own nice search features and keyboard navigation.

**[jQuery Source Viewer](http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.4&fn=css)** - a quick and easy way to search through the jQuery source code.  Something that every jQuery developer should start doing after they learn the basics of jQuery.

I am looking forward to updating my projects to jQuery 1.4 and jQuery UI 1.8.  Will be interesting to see what the jQuery community can produce next.
