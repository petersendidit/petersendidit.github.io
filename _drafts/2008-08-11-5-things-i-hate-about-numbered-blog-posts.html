1. If they are over 5-8 items they are usless because you know the poster just didn't spend time to atcualy look and review the links that he is posting.

2. You have to swim through all the links or items that they throw at you in the list to find out if you care about any of them.  No you have just spent the time that the blog poster should have done.

3. They are a quick and easy way to throw content out.   (See even I can do it)

4. Most of the time there is only 1 or 2 links in the list that is even worth being in the list to start with.

5. Every blog in the world does it and you find the same Top 100 links / images / ideas / software lists mulitple times on different sites.

I just keep getting the dang Top # lists in my RSS reader and most of the time they are worthless to me because I am not going to spend to sift through all of them and figure out which one is good.  If the blogger had spent the time to review each link dwindle it down to the 5 they like the most and then write to us about why and the possitves and negatives of each that is worth it but get rid of these Top 100 lists please! Thank you :-).
