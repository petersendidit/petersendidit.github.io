I got my start in web work while I was a youth intern at First United Methodist Church Round Rock, Texas.  I was just about to start 10th grade and was handed NetObjectsFusion and was told to go make a web site for the youth group.  From that point on I have been working on web site and designs.  When I got my job at Alchemy Systems I stopped doing freelance work because I didn't have the time.  No that Alchemy has changed from a web development shop to having just 2 products that we work on I have started to miss working with web sites.

This desire to start working with sites is what spurred me to to start this blog.  Soon after a friend of mine showed me the company web site for his roomates company, I offered to help clean up the design some.  About 3 days later I got a call from one of the guy I did a web site for about 5 years go asking if I was interested in creating a web site for his new realestate business.  Seems like all I needed to do was start the ball rolling with this blog and everything fell in to place for more freelance work.
