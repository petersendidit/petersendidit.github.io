I started using foxmarks right about the time it first came out in 2006.  I wanted my bookmarks at work to match the ones on my home computer.  I have since moved away from having 2 computers but I still have the firefox pluggin installed.  Why? Well, for one foxmarks versions your bookmark library each time it syncs so you have a way to go back and find that bookmark you deleted because you never though you would need it again.  Foxmarks has just released a new product that will allow you to sync your bookmarks between computers and browsers.  They now support Firefox, IE and Safari.  This is great news for those of us that don't use Safari but have and iPhone.  By setting up foxmarks to sync with Safari I now can have my uptodate Firefox bookmarks on my iPhone.

Check it out!
