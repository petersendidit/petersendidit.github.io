Finally after many months of me putting it off, I finally sat down and finished designing and slicing my new blog design.  Decided to stay with the old dP logo that I design back in college for myself.  I had stopped liking the logo for a while but after a few comments about it in the last few months by people I started enjoying it a bit more.  There are still some quirks of the wordpress theme that I need to take care of, just realized I never finished implementing the design for the comments, but those are things I can take care of in the next day or so.
