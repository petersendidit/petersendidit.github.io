I worked on an issue today on a site I helped design and develop about 2 years ago.  While I was poking around looking at code and using the site I kept thinking "Man this is BAD!".  It is interesting how as you continue to learn and expand the stuff that you have created in the past becomes something you dislike and don't want to put your name to anymore.  I have looked back at the old FUMC Round Rock web designs I created from the time I was sophmore in high school (1999/2000) to 2007 its amazing how different each one is and how much better I got a design and coding.

The goal should be to get to a point were the code that you are righting is good enough that it just needs updating never a full re-write.  But with web work and how quickly standards and the "correct" way to do things change it hard to know if you are really getting there or not.  Guess I will just have to wait a few years to find out.
