Just emailed this to Cultured Code because of a bug I was having with their Things app.

I just updated to the Iphone 3.0 OS and also the newest Things app for the iphone that was said to support iphone 3.0.  When I open up the iphone app and sync it with the desktop app it opens the sync window on both the iphone and the desktop, goes through the normal process and then when the desktop sync window goes away the iphone is still sitting there syncing.  I can let it sit there forever and it will never finish.

Things (Mac): 1.1.2 (941)
Things (iPhone/iPod touch): 1.3.7

I got this response about 5 min later. (very nice turn around time!)

<blockquote>Thanks for reporting this bug.

We are already working on a fix. You can continue to sync Things on your Mac with your iPhone or iPod touch as the sync is completed successfully. It's just an interface bug that prevents the Sync screen from disappearing. Simply press the home button to quit Things on your iPhone, after Things on your Mac has completed syncing.

If you start Things again, the Sync screen will appear again. If that's not what you want, you can either:
- Not have Things (Mac) and Things (iPhone/iPod touch) running at the same time.
- Before opening Things on your mobile device, wait until you are no longer on the same Wi-Fi network as your Mac.
- Temporarily disconnect your Mac from your Wi-Fi network.

Sorry for the inconvenience. An update that fixes this issue should be available soon.

Best,
Chris</blockquote>
